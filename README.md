### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- Google Books API
- IMDB API

### Data

- There will be data for user profiles as well as general media data. Each media item will have various properties depending on the type of media. All media will be categorized by genre. See full data model here: https://dbdiagram.io/d/605cf99cecb54e10c33d4cbe
