## Project Proposal

### Overview

This personal library app allows users to log and organize their media into collections. Users can set and track progress to goals, share ratings and reviews, and visualize their media consumption in various ways.

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- APIs and data sources coming soon...

### Data

- There will be data for user profiles as well as general media data. Each media item will have various properties depending on the type of media. All media will be categorized by genre. See full data model here: https://dbdiagram.io/d/605cf99cecb54e10c33d4cbe
